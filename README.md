# STUDYMAP
STUDYMAP is a tool created for students to assist them in clarifying, which education is ideal for them.
This tool essentially works by getting the user to answer a series of questions and then calculating, based on K-Nearest Neighbours and Euclidean distance in an N-dimensional space, which education is closest to their answers.
